Exercise :: The MongoDB Node.js Driver
======================================

These are a series of exercises to get you familiar with the MongoDB Node.js driver. The reference material, to help you solve these problems can be found in the MongoDB documentation:

* http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/2.2/reference/ecmascript6/crud/
* http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/2.2/api/Collection.html

Each exercise has at least one `TODO` comment in it, that explains what you need to do, to complete the exercise.

#### Testing your Work

1. Make sure mongodb is installed on your computer (see https://github.com/losandes/Heinz95729/wiki if you don't already have it installed)
1. git clone this repository if you haven't already
1. Make sure you `npm install` in the parent directory before running these exercises
1. If it isn't already running, start MongoDB. In a terminal/console window, execute, `mongod`
1. In another terminal/console window, execute: `node exercise`
1. Type the number of the exercise you want to test. When you're done, you can type "all" instead of a number, to execute all of the exercises.
